on how to store entered data
1. HashTables.
2.getproperty
3.Java DB

5. make a file for every action or everyproperty related to student and arrange all the properties of different objects in that one file.
5. In a Json file somehow
6.hashtables + 5th one
7. make a file for every roll no and store details of every actvity by keeping that activity related to the data somehow using hastables or json files
